learningObjectives:
  - Update data in MongoDB

hints:
  - "Remember, under the studio `moviesquest`, in the `reels` collection, lies our distorted reel, [Stephen Hawking’s Universe]. "
  - "Once you find the movie, you'll see the `year` field has the letter `e` in it, which is wrong."
  - "Did you change the `year` to the correct type?"
  - "There are different ways to update the data: the Atlas UI, the MongoDB Compass, or the Mongo API."
