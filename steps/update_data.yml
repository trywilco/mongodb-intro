learningObjectives:
  - Update data in MongoDB

hints:
  - "Search for the movie `Stephen Hawking's Universe` in the `movies` collection under the `sample_mflix` database."
  - "Once you find the movie, you'll see the `year` field has the letter `e` in it, which is wrong."
  - "Did you change the `year` to the correct type?"
  - "There are different ways to update the data: the Atlas UI, the mongo shell, or the mongo API."
